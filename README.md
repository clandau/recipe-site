# The Landau Family Recipe Archive 

🍊 🍐 🍏 🥑 🍉

We had a lot of recipes on Evernote, and that process was no longer working for us. So I exported them all to markdown files and made this static site for them to live.
The markdown files may have broken images, links, be not nice formatting thanks to export funky-ness. I'll fix them as I go/desire. 

## Uses Eleventy, Netlify CMS, Netlify hosting, Bootstrap and lots of love.
