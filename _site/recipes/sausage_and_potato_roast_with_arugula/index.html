  <h1>Sausage and Potato Roast with Arugula sheet pan</h1>
<p>SERVINGS: 4</p>
<p>TIME: ABOUT 45 MINUTES</p>
<p>SOURCE: <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/sausage-and-potato-pan-roast">ADAPATED FROM FOOD &amp; WINE</a></p>
<p>I ended up tweaking a few of the amounts — I needed weights for potatoes because I’m exacting and found a 5-ounce clamshell of washed baby arugula to be more than enough for the dish. And I needed more cooking time. Yours, too, will probably vary a little depending on the thickness and of your sausages and potato cuts. I can get shallots easily but I do think if they’re a pain for you to get that red onion wedges (I’d cut up 2 to 3 large ones) would work too.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 3/4 pounds mixed unpeeled potatoes (red, yukon gold, fingerlings or russet), if small/baby, cut in half, if larger, in 1-inch thick wedges</li>
<li>10 medium (about 1/2 pound) unpeeled shallots, halved</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1 1/2 pounds sweet Italian sausage, cut into 3-inch lengths</li>
<li>One 5-ounce package of baby arugula or one 8-ounce bundle, stemmed and chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat oven to 425°. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss all of the potatoes and shallots with 3 tablespoons olive oil, salt (I use 1 teaspoon kosher), and a lot freshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste. Roast for 15 minutes, at which they’ll be barely beginning to color. Give them a toss and add sausages. Brush the tops with a little olive oil and return the tray to the oven for another 30 to 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the sausage is cooked through.</p>
<p>To finish: Transfer everything on the tray to a big bowl and add arugula, lemon juice, and more salt and pepper to taste. Serve right away.</p>
