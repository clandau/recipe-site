## Rotisserie Chicken Coconut Curry Soup

Serves 6 to 8

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 tablespoon finely grated peeled fresh ginger (about a 1-inch piece of ginger)

2 cloves garlic, minced

3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste

6 cups (48 ounces) low-sodium chicken broth

1 (13- to 14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk

6 cups thinly sliced lacinato or Tuscan kale leaves (from 1 large bunch)

Kosher salt

1 (8-ounce) package vermicelli rice noodles

1 (2-pound) plain rotisserie chicken, meat shredded (about 4 1/2 cups)

Chopped fresh cilantro, thinly sliced red onion, and lime wedges, for serving

In a 5-quart or larger Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes.

Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, and kale. Stir to combine, bring to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, until the kale is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt to taste.

Add the noodles and continue to simmer until the noodles are al dente, about 3 minutes or according to package instructions.

Divide the soup among bowls and top each bowl with about 1/2 cup shredded chicken. Garnish with the cilantro, onion slices, and a big squeeze of lime juice.

### Recipe Notes

* Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 5 days.
* Freezing: Because it contains coconut milk, which can separate when defrosted, and thin rice noodles, which can become mushy when reheated, this soup doesn't freeze well. If you do want to freeze it, hold back both the coconut milk and noodles and add them directly to the reheated soup. If done this way, the soup will freeze well for up to 3 months.
