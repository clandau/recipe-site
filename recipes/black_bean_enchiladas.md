**Black Bean Enchiladas:**

1 tbsp olive oil

1/2 cup onion, chopped

1 tsp ground cumin

1 cup frozen fire-roasted whole kernel corn, thawed

3/4 cup chunky medium salsa

1 can (15 oz) black beans, rinsed and drained

1/4 cup shredded low-fat cheddar or Mexican blend cheese

10 corn tortillas (6 inch)

1 can (10 oz) enchilada sauce

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 11x7-inch (2 quart) baking dish with cooking spray. 

In 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and cumin; cook and stir 4 to 5 minutes or until onion is tender. Stir in corn, salsa, beans and half of the cheese. Remove sauce from heat. 

On microwavable plate, stack tortillas and cover with damp paper towel; microwave on high for 1 minute to soften. Place 1/4 cup bean mixture along center of each tortilla. Roll up tightly, and place seam sides down in baking dish. Spoon remaining bean mixture on top. Pour sauce over enchiladas, spreading to coat all tortillas evenly. 

Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until sauce is bubbly around edges. Top with remaining cheese. Makes 10 servings. Enjoy!
