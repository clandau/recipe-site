### DESCRIPTION

Baked Penne with Meatballs! No-boil, fail-proof, garlic-buttery, easy dreamy weeknight dinner. SO GOOD! 

### INGREDIENTS

Baked Penne:

* 8 ounces
* 1 28-ounce can
* 2 cups
* 1/2 cup
* 3 cloves
* 1 teaspoon
* 1 teaspoon
* 2 teaspoons
* 1-2 teaspoons
* meatballs

At the end:

* a few handfuls of grated parmesean

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Mix all of the baked penne ingredients together in a 9×13 baking dish. Cover tightly with foil (double layer isn’t a bad idea).
3. Bake for 35-40 minutes.
4. Remove foil (HOT HOT HOT) and give it a stir. Add spinach and top with Parm, and brown it up for 3-5 minutes under the broiler. Let it stand for a few minutes so the sauce has a chance to thicken up. Voila!
