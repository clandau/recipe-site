### INSTRUCTIONS

Season the chicken with lemon juice, garlic, cumin, oil, salt and spices. Set aside at least 15 minutes, or as long as overnight.

Combine the ingredients for the white yogurt sauce and refrigerate.

When ready to cook, heat a large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium high heat. When hot, add the chicken and leave until the bottom is completely browned, about 5 minutes before flipping.

Cook on the other side for another 4 to 5 minutes, until browned.

Reduce the heat to low and let the chicken continue cooking, about 10 minutes, until just about cooked through in the thickest parts (no worries if it’s not completely cooked).

Set aside on a cutting board and chop the chicken into thin strips and add back to the pan to brown and finish cooking, 8 to 10 minutes over medium heat.

Assemble the salad by dividing the lettuce, tomato and red onion.

Top with chicken and drizzle with yogurt sauce (this is your dressing) and harissa, if desired.
